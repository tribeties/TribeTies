At TribeTies, our journey begins with personal stories of triumph over life's toughest challenges. Founded by a group of passionate women who have walked the paths of grief, trauma, relationship struggles, and facing terminal illnesses, we understand the importance of a supportive community in times of need.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between shared experiences and healing. We've harnessed the power of technology to create an app that connects individuals who are navigating the complex landscapes of grief, trauma, relationship issues, and terminal illnesses. We believe that by fostering connections among those who've faced similar hardships, we can offer a virtual haven of understanding, compassion, and hope.

TribeTies is more than an appâ€”it's a lifeline for anyone seeking solace and connection. Our commitment is to make mental health accessible, destigmatize conversations, and provide a platform where your pain can be transformed into strength. Join us in forging a path to healing together, whether you're seeking support, understanding, or a place to share your journey.

Let's break down barriers, lift each other up, and create a world where nobody has to face their struggles alone. Welcome to the TribeTies community, where hearts connect and souls heal.
